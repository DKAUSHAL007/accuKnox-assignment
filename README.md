# React Widget Dashboard

This is a React-based widget dashboard application that allows users to manage widgets in various categories. The key features include adding, removing, and searching for widgets.

## Features

- **Add Widgets:** Easily add new widgets to a category using the "Add Widget" button.
- **Remove Widgets:** Each widget has a remove (cross) button that allows you to delete the widget.
